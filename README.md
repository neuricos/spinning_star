# Spinning Star

**Author**: Zetian Chen

## Description

In this project, I attempt to create the effect of taking photos of stars in the dark sky. If we set the exposure time of the camera longer, there would be tails after stars to show the trail that each star moved.

In this application, users can click on the graphical user interface and drag the slider bars to change the way the "sky" looks like. Moreover, users can press the mouse on the sky and drag it to create more stars. There is also a "clear" button at the end of the gui so that users can clean out the "sky" if they want to.
